# GoodPlate-IA 🍽️

GoodPlate-IA is a mobile application built with Expo that uses AI to analyze images of food plates, providing a breakdown of the percentage of different food groups (e.g., proteins, vegetables, carbs) present. This project is based on a tutorial by Rodrigo Gonçalves on YouTube, and it was developed to practice AI image analysis in mobile applications.
